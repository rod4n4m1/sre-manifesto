# The SRE Manifesto

We, site reliability engineers from all over the world, met together to discover better ways of defining who is the site reliability engineer (SRE) persona.

We believe we can create a more unified, concise, and solid SRE persona by stating their essential responsibilities:

* SREs make sure their `systems` are `reliable` and not just available and resilient.

* SREs guarantee all systems and applications are `observable` and under `monitoring`.

* SREs manage systems, services, and infrastructure to learn how to `automate toil`.

* SREs use `data science` and `statistical methods` to understand the observability of data.

* SREs identify, measure, and reduce `toil` arising from operational and engineering work.

* SREs implement `test cases`, execute software `delivery tests`, and stay ahead with `capacity planning`.

* SREs employ `chaos engineering` to unveil systemic weaknesses in production.

We welcome anyone to use this **manifesto** at will as we made it public. We will review this **manifesto** in the GitHub repository and update it yearly.

`August 22, 2022`.
