| STH100 | [x] Systems Thinking | **Solution Full Stack Analysis for Reliability** | Analyze the solution technology full stack to check its reliabiliy | Applicable to any industry or system | Diagram editors like draw.io | 1. Plot all functional components of the solution, including the infrastructure, application, and user layers; 2. Analyze the dependencies and interconnections among them; 3. Synthesize the system behavior based on the individual component behaviors; 4. Discover single points of failure bad design patterns, and monitoring blind spots. |
