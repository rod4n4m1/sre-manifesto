| DOE100 | [x] DevOps; [x] Automation | **Infrastructure Provisioning through Code** | Provision infrastructure components by applying infrastrucure as code (IaC) | Applicable to all industries and systems | IaC technologies such as Terraform | 1. Declare the infrastructure desided state by using an IaC scripting; 2. Deploy infrastructure to the target environment by executing the IaC scripts; 3. Test the new infrastructure and adjust the IaC scripts if necessary; 4. Save the IaC scripts to a source code versioning system like GitHub; 5. Any changes to the infrastructure goes through the IaC scripts and subsequent execution of them. |
