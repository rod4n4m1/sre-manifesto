| OBS100 | [x] Observability | Obserability Golden Signals | Use golden signals to detect end-user symptoms for systems and platforms | Applicable to any system | Application performance monitorin; synthetic user monitoring | 1. Define service level indicators (SLIs) for latency, error rate, traffic, and saturation for each critical end-user service; 2. Measure SLIs through the monitoring platform; 3. Establish the SLOs based on the process behaviour and business requirements. |
