| DSC100 | [x] Data Science; [x] Observability | **Time-series Data Analysis through Percentiles** | Analyze time-series data, mainly monitoring metrics, by applying percentiles or quantiles to the dataset. | Applicable to all industries | Time-series DB based monitoring systems like Prometheus | 1. Collect monitoring metric data points as a time-series dataset; 2. Analyze the series by applying percentile or quantile methods; 3. Calculate the relevant percentiles or quantiles (preferable based on an SLO) to uncover outliers; 4. Isolate outliers to see if they are errors or problems. |
