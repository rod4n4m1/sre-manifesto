# The SRE Manifesto

## Project

The SRE Manifesto project is a timid endeavor with three bold goals:

1. Publish and maintain a universal site reliability engineering manifesto.
2. Curate a collection of high-level site reliability engineering practices.
3. Hold a comprehensive list of site reliability engineering resources.
