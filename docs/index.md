## Short version

An open-source site reliability engineering manifesto of the SREs, by the SREs, for the SREs.

## TL;DR version

### Intro

In 2003, Google published the book titled **Site Reliability Engineering** unveiling the operational model behind its notorious success. Although it's a well-written work, it didn't intend to prescribe the primary responsibilities of a site reliability engineer (SRE) or their core skills.

The SRE Manifesto is a timid project that conveys the SRE's primary responsibilities and core skills in a single document, thus giving shape to this profession outside Google and trying to universalize the role. Also, it intends to be a vendor-agnostic one-stop shop for all precious **Site Reliability Engineering** practices and resources.

### Basic Definitions

| **Term** | **Definition** |
|:---------|:---------------|
| **Reliability** | A measurement of how trustworthy a system or service is. It's a function of many other dimensions, including availability, resiliency, robustness, scalability, security, and performance. |
| **Site Reliability Engineer** | A person that employs Site Reliability Engineering to applications, platforms, solutions, systems, and services. |
| **Site Reliability Engineering** | An engineering discipline that combines software and systems engineering aspects, practices, and techniques and applies them to infrastructure and operations problems to improve overall reliability. |

### Background

We started this work with the **Becoming a Rockstar SRE** [book](https://packt.link/H0G2R) as its appendix; however, site reliability engineering is too big to fit into a single book.

### Who should read this document?

Besides site reliability engineers (SREs), we recommend the following audience for this manifesto:

* DevOps Engineers
* Platform Engineers
* Cloud Engineers
* Performance Engineers
* Software Engineers
* Engineering managers

And all managerial roles that are interested in understanding what an SRE does.
