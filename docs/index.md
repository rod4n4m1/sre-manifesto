## TL;DR version

### Intro

In 2003, Google published the book titled **Site Reliability Engineering** unveiling the operational model behind its notorious success. Although it's a well-written work, it didn't intend to prescribe the primary responsibilities of a site reliability engineer (SRE) or their core skills.

The SRE Manifesto is a timid project to convey the SRE's primary responsibilities and core skills in a single document, thus giving shape to this profession outside Google and trying to universalize the role.

### Background

We started this work with the **Becoming a Rockstar SRE** [book](https://packt.link/H0G2R) as its appendix; however, site reliability engineering is too big to fit into a single book.

### Who should read this document?

Besides site reliability engineers, we recommend the following audience for this manifesto:

* DevOps Engineers
* Platform Engineers
* Cloud Engineers
* Performance Engineers
* Software Engineers
* Engineering managers

And all managerial roles that are interested in understanding what a SRE does.
